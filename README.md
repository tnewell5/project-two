## Gift Guru
(Your guide to a unique gift for someone special)

#### by: Tanya Newell

#### App Link: http://tnewell5.github.io/project-two/
#### How to use the app:
Use the app to search for a unique handmade gift or a local event, then save any items/ events on your Gift Ideas Pinboard by dragging and dropping the item/ event image. You may also click the item/ event image at any time to go directly to the website to view additional details/ make a purchase.

#### APIs:
For this app, I've used the Etsy and Eventful APIs.

#### Languages:
This app was build using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

#### Process
This was a very interesting project, where I got to practice the design and implementation from start to end.

#### Challenges:
 - APIs cross-domain issue, which I learned to solve using JSONP.
 - Learning to navigate Etsy's API.
 - Figuring out the Pinboard, and choosing the right elements to remove/ append.


 #### Final Thoughts:
 I am now a lot more comfortable using various APIs. After practicing with Etsy's API, I breathed through Eventful's API. Have learned how to create interactive elements like the pinboard.
